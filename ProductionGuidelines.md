EUTC Production Guidelines
==========================
This version adopted 17/10/2019

# 1. Proposing a Show
## 1.1 TIMELINE
The EUTC selects shows at General Meetings (GMs), open to all members, and usually held on a Wednesday. The Productions Manager will open proposals about two weeks before a GM, making clear what you can apply for (i.e. which classifications, and how many slots for each). There are two deadlines to consider:
- **By the Submission deadline (18:00, Monday 10 days before the GM), you must have submitted your first draft.** Make it as complete as possible. Committee will point out any omissions, and may offer advice, which you don’t have to take.
- **By the Editing deadline (18:00, Friday 5 days before the GM) you must have completed your final draft.** Committee will block any proposal that doesn’t strictly meet the requirements of the Constitution (clause 6B/3). The rules are mostly common sense: don’t propose anything illegal or dangerous, name a member in each required role. That sort of thing. Supplementary events must be presented to the Committee at least two weeks before the Editing Deadline.
- If these deadlines are moved back, Committee will make that clear. 

At the GM, your team will generally have three minutes to stand up and pitch your proposal to the room. Talk to the Productions Manager if you need help preparing. The Chair of the GM will talk you through it on the day if you ask.
## 1.2 CLASSIFICATIONS
All EUTC events are either “Reserved” or “Supplementary”. The difference is described in the Constitution (clause 6A/4), but in short:
- *Reserved events* are predictable. The Committee creates a calendar each year allocating certain times (usually whole weeks) to certain classifications. The slots in this calendar are then filled by the shows voted on at GMs
- *Supplementary events* fill in the gaps. Examples include our long-running Candlewasters new writing showcase, sketch shows, site-specific theatre outside Bedlam, etc. Their budgets and timings are entirely unspecified, giving you a lot of freedom. However, they must work around Reserved events, and cannot clash with them without permission.
### Types of Reserved show
- *Lunchtimes*
  - **1 or 2 performances**
  - **EUTC grant: £65 without rights, £125 with rights**
  - Less financial risk, but fewer resources.
  - Can be good for new teams, or for more experimental ideas.
- *Mainterms*
  - **3 to 5 performances**
  - **EUTC grant: £850 without rights, £1050 with rights**
  - Larger budget, longer run, more high profile.
  - More resources mean it is more demanding on the production teams, but they can be bigger and bolder.
- *Pantomime*
  - The final week of Semester 1
  - Administratively identical to a Mainterm show, except it’s a panto.
- *Friday Night Improv*
  - 22:30, weekly throughout term-time.
  - EUTC grant: Discuss with the Business Manager.
- *Freshers’ Play*
  - Week 2, semester 1.
  - EUTC grant: Discuss with the Business Manager.
  - Freshers’ Play itself is proposed near the end of the academic year, to be run as an induction event the following September. Ask the Productions Manager for details.
  - **This is a Mandatory event (see Constitution 6B/9)**
- *Freshers’ Slots*
  - The penultimate week of Semester 1.
  - Three separate shows in one night.
  - EUTC grant: £40 + Rights
  - The assumption is that the show teams are predominantly composed of those new to the
EUTC.
  - Extremely low pressure, with a high level of support from the EUTC Committee
- *EUTC Fringe show*
  - During one of the slots allocated to us by Bedlam Fringe. There will be at least one a year, usually two.
  - EUTC grant: Discuss with the Business Manager. Note that there is no venue cost.
  - One of the best ways to take a show to Fringe in a familiar environment with minimal pressure.
  - Marketing, and logistics at Fringe can be very different to term-time; it is a good idea to talk at length to relevant members of Committee before proposing.
### Festivals
Festivals are events where the Committee delegate many of their responsibility to a Subcommittee: the festival team. (This is fully explained in the Constitution; Articles 4C and 6C). They are usually week-long events (but can be shorter) and include a self-contained programme, usually including small-scale performances and workshops. Festivals are not shows, but they are proposed in the same way, and can still be classed as “Reserved” or “Supplementary” in exactly the same way.
**By the Editing deadline, Festival proposals must have at least one named Administrator/Convenor,** who is responsible for running the festival team and ensuring the event happens. **Before the event actually happens, the team must have gained:**
- **A technical manager**
- **A theatre manager**
- **A box office manager** (if there is a box office)
- **A café manager** (if the café is to be used)
- **A marketing manager**

The festival team can curate their program by any method they choose. They may also set prices, menus and marketing policies. Festival teams must maintain regular communication with the Committee, as the Theatre Manager still holds the license during this time and is still responsible.
There are two Reserved festivals each year:
- *Welcome Week* takes place in Week 0 of Semester 1. This is a Mandatory event (see Constitution 6B/9)
- *Bedlam Festival* (or BedFest) takes place in Week 1 of Semester 2.
## 1.3 WHAT SHOULD YOUR PROPOSAL INCLUDE? 
The proposal forms are on the members’ section of the website. There are two main boxes; publicity text (a brief blurb) and proposal text (the body of your proposal, split up under broad headings like “Direction”, “Props” and “Tech”). Looking at old proposals is recommended for getting a feel of what is expected there. However, your proposal must include:
- **Your team.** 
  - **Show proposals must include at least: a Director, a Producer, a Stage Manager and a Technical Manager.** Festivals are different (see above). 
  - **Everyone listed on the proposal must have EUTC membership** (purchased on the EUSA website or at the box office, but must be activated by emailing the Secretary) 
- **A justifiable budget, passed by the Business Manager**
  - This includes both expenditure (what you plan to spend) and income (consisting of an EUTC  grant and your own fundraising targets). - Expenditure is usually split into: Rights/Publicity/Tech/Set/Costume/Props/Admin, and a Contingency which is 10% of all the others combined. 
  - If you’re proposing a show with an unconventional budget, it is a good idea to chat with the Business Manager before proposing. 
  - By the editing deadline, your budget must have been sent to, and approved by, the Business Manager, regardless of what type of performance you are proposing 
  - **Supplementary Events must make back their EUTC grant, preferably through their ticket sales, or as a last resort through retroactive fundraising.**
  - It should be noted that Supplementary Events must make their money back. Shows that fail to do this will be required to fundraise retrospectively. 
- **Details on performance rights** – your legal licence to perform. 
  - (You obviously don’t need these for original writing, or works out of copyright) - We strongly encourage trying to get a proformance/prospective license drawn up before proposal as if successful, the invoice will need to be processed and paid as soon as possible. 
  - **Without rights, you aren’t legally allowed to start rehearsals!** 
  - (More details in section 2). 
- At the end of the proposal there are a number of simple questions to be answered (e.g. length of 
the show and gender breakdown of characters, although an increasing number of shows audition and cast gender-blind) 

*N.B. For a detailed explanation of the process by which show proposals are selected, please see Articles 5A, 5B, 6A and 6B of the EUTC Constitution*
# 2. From Passing to Performing
## 2.1 Immediate Next Steps 
- **Show teams must make a concerted effort to get at least three members of their team Duty Manager trained.** The Front of House Manager *(foh@bedlamtheatre.co.uk)* will run regular sessions to facilitate this and has discretion to require more than three team members be DM trained on larger teams. 
- **Shows must nominate two welfare contacts before rehearsals begin.** We recommend having a welfare contact for the cast, and a separate one for the crew, both of whom must have suitable emotional distance from the rest of the other welfare contact. 
- **Show teams must start sending a representative to Company Meetings every Monday night.**
## 2.2 RIGHTS 
If your piece is out of copyright (such as Shakespeare), or original writing by an EUTC member then you will not need rights! 
- **For original writing by an EUTC member, the writer must approve the choice of Director and Producer by emailing the Committee.** 
- All original writing must be sent to the Archives Subcommittee after your final performance: *archives@bedlamtheatre.co.uk*

**Rights are LEGALLY needed for rehearsals to begin,** so you should organise a prospective license/license invoice before the GM so you can send this to Business Manager for quick payment. 
### Advice 
- Published versions of the script should include details of who to contact about rights, usually a 
company like Samuel French. 
- Apply for rights ASAP after the GM. It sometimes takes a while for them to come through, so 
allow two weeks for them to be paid. 
- You will need to inform the rights company of the length of your run. 
- Some playwrights will not allow any changes to the script, others may allow a certain amount; 
check this to avoid hassle later. 
- To avoid paying too much, stress that it is an amateur production, by a non-profit making theatre company, in a student theatre with a capacity under 100. 
- Check that the playwright is VAT registered as we can claim the VAT back.
- You can ask actors to buy their own copy of the script. If you are going to photocopy them, you should do it yourself and collect money from each cast member to pay for it. 
## 2.3 AUDITIONS AND CASTING
Immediately following the GM, the Productions Manager will arrange a suitable time and place for auditions to be held, in conversation with the relevant show teams. Typically, there are two days of auditions, followed by another evening of callbacks.
Show teams should bring their own audition material (around 50 pieces is recommended), and a short show blurb, printed, to auditions. 
Should an actor audition for multiple shows and be fortunate enough to get cast in more than one of them, it is at the discretion of the actor which part they accept. 

## 2.4 REHEARSALS 
###### This section was reviewed by the Secretary, who can be contacted at secretary@bedlamtheatre.co.uk
Rehearsals in Bedlam and EUSA buildings (Teviot and Pleasance) will be available to every show team. Priority will be given to shows that will perform sooner. Show teams should inform the Secretary of their preferred rehearsal times. 
To request additional rehearsal space, email the Secretary at *secretary@bedlamtheatre.co.uk* detailing which rooms you would like, the date, time, and what show team/project it is for. Extra rehearsal spaces in university buildings can also be booked by any University of Edinburgh student via MyEd. Should you require assistance on how to do so, contact the Secretary. If you have a small cast, rehearsing in flats (or any other space you can find) might be a good idea. 
### Rules for rehearsing in Bedlam: 
- Please refer to the section labelled Being in the Building. 
### Rules for EUSA room use: 
- **Do not book a room directly with EUSA under the EUTC’s name.** Please ask the Secretary 
instead. 
- If allocated a room, use the room. It is EUSA policy that if the room is found unoccupied during our room booking slot, the society might not be able to book EUSA rooms in the future. 
- Leave the room in the state that you found it. All chairs/tables should be put back in the same way that they were found in, and all rubbish should be completely cleared away. If the society gets any complaints about rooms not being left as they were found or rooms going unused, the show teams responsible may lose access to them. 
- If you are allocated a room and no longer want/need it: 
  - More than 1 week before the booking: 
    - Contact the Secretary or offer it up on the EUTC Room Bookings Facebook group. If no one takes it, the Secretary will offer it up to other societies or cancel the booking. 
  - More than 24 hours before the booking: 
    - Contact the Secretary and they will find another use for it as above, but they cannot cancel it with EUSA. 
  - Less than 24 hours before the booking: 
    - Contact the Secretary and they will try to find another use for it as above, but it is likely that  the room will have to be babysat. This literally means having someone sit in it for the duration of the slot. If you can’t find someone, the Secretary will be able to help. 
## 2.5 PUBLICITY 
###### This section was reviewed by the Marketing Manager, who can be contacted at marketing@bedlamtheatre.co.uk
### Online publicity 
- Cast and production team lists are a great way to hype up your show early on (and people really like them). Make sure to include your prod team as they are just as important! 
- **If you do make one, they are due within a week of your show being cast,** so it’s a good idea to  start thinking about this before you have a cast. 
- Your show will be made public on the Bedlam website two weeks before opening night. 
- **A Facebook event cover and cover photo for the page are both needed.** Please be aware they are slightly different sizes (event cover is 1920 x 1080 pixels and the cover photo is 820 x 312). 
- **You must send your show blurb and Facebook event cover to the marketing manager at least 16 days before opening night** so your Facebook and EUSA event can go up in time. 
- Trailers are not necessary, but they are fun and good for exposure. If you do produce one, this can be sent to the Marketing Manager and uploaded to the Bedlam page in the run up to your show. 
- The Bedlam Instagram and Twitter will also publicise the show, but encourage cast members to post as much as they can to reach a wide audience. 
- Speak to the Marketing Manager if you are interested in obtaining sponsorship. This can be good for publicity, and for your budget. 
### Posters 
You need to design a poster. This can look pretty much however you want, but it must include: 
- **‘The EUTC Presents’, or ‘The Edinburgh University Theatre Company Presents’.**
- **Title of show - Dates (including year) and times** 
- **Correct prices** 
- **Both the EUTC and Bedlam Theatre logos** 
  - If not performing at Bedlam, the Bedlam Theatre logo is not necessary.
  - Logos are available on the Bedlam website, or from the Marketing Manager. 
- **Any specific requirements of your rights agreement.** 
- **Correct spelling of the above.**
The Marketing Manager will ask to see your posters before they're printed to check they’re of a high standard. The Marketing Manager will print an A0 version of your poster out of their budget to be put up outside Bedlam the week of your show. 
You don’t have to print your own posters, however they can be useful for advertising around campus. 
  - **If putting them up in university buildings, you will need the EUSA stamp.** This can be obtained in the Potterrow Societies office. 
- A3 is a good size for posters (and the university won't allow anything larger) however experiment as you want since non-standard sizes can look more striking. 
- Get the cast and crew to help you distribute them. **Don't put your posters over other posters** (unless that event has finished). 
- Put some posters up around Bedlam. It's a good idea to have some posters up in the building a couple of weeks before your show goes up, even if it's not quite the finished article. 
- Printing takes time depending on how much you pay. Teviot Print Shop is quick but slightly 
pricey, and there are cheap companies online you can use, but remember to do it far enough in advance that they arrive in time. 
### Flyers 
- Flyers are most effective during Fringe and Freshers Week. 
- To be as sustainable as possible, think carefully about how useful flyers will be, where you will hand them out, and how many you will need. 
- **Flyers must include the same basic design elements as posters (see above).** 
### Other points 
- If you don't feel artistic, or are stuck with ideas or technical know-how, then there are plenty of people who can help with graphic design. The Marketing Manager will be able to help or suggest people to ask. 
- Getting the press in for interviews, previews, or reviews will help sell the show. Get information out early, typically at least two weeks before the show. Keep reminding press about the show. 
- Programmes are expensive and can be a drain on resources, but can help to enhance your audience experience and make good souvenirs. **If you do want to produce them, they must include ‘Edinburgh University Theatre Company Presents’ and both the EUTC and Bedlam Theatre logos.** 
## 2.6 QUESTIONNAIRES 
###### This section was reviewed by the Theatre Manager, Set Manager and Technical Manager. 
**Questionnaires are forms that your show team are required to fill out by 18:00 on the Monday before your Get In.** They are read by members of the Committee so they can support your show. 
Questionnaires are located at the bottom of your show page on the Bedlam website, and will usually go live a week before they are due. Questionnaires will only show if you are listed as a member of the show team. 
There are 4 questionnaires: 
- *Tech Manager Questionnaire (TMQs)*
  - This is where you list everything that is going to be done tech-wise. 
  - It is read by the Tech Manager. 
  - Your tech manager will fill it out. 
- *Stage Manager Questionnaire (SMQs)*
  - This questionnaire is about anything stage or set related. 
  - It is read by the Set and Theatre Managers.
  - Your stage manager (and set manager if you have one) will fill it out. 
- *Costume Manager Questionnaire (CMQs)*
  - This concerns anything and everything related to costumes.
  - It is read by the Wardrobe Manager.
  - Your costume manager (or stage manager if you don’t have one) will fill it out.
- *Producer Questionnaire (PQs)* 
  - This is about the show details, including run time, ticketing, and publicity.
  - It is read by the Front of House Manager.
  - It will be filled out by your producer(s). 
  
If you need help to answer your questionnaire, or are unable to complete your questionnaire by the deadline, please contact the relevant Committee member before the deadline. 
## 2.7 GET INS 
A get in is the time that is allocated for your play to rig and focus your lights, and prepare the stage for your show. Get ins start on Saturday at 2pm for Mainterms productions or Sunday at 2pm for Lunchtimes productions.
- A get in can be very hectic. You must plan ahead for it. Coordinate with the teams before and after you to work most efficiently. 
- **You must fit the Improverts rehearsal at 18:00-20:00 each Sunday into your plan.** This involves clearing the stage as much as you can and being quiet for the duration (good time to get some supper). 
- If you wish to store props, wood, or anything else in Bedlam for your show before the get in, please talk to the Set Manager. 
### Extended get ins / get outs 
You may request for more time for your get in or get out at a Company Meeting. Normally, an extended get in starts at 09:00 Saturday, but can start earlier. To qualify: 
- **It must be requested at least 2 weeks before your first performance.**
- **There must be an obvious requirement for it.**
- **It must not conflict with any other show or event, or any conflict must have been agreed to.** You don’t get one automatically. It is your responsibility to find out and talk all shows or events that may be affected before the meeting. Consult the production schedule or ask Committee if you are unsure. 
### Regular weekly events 
- 21:00-23:30 Friday - Imps show 
- 12:00-14:00 Saturday - Imps workshop 
- 12:00-14:00 Sunday - Maintenance 
- 18:00-20:00 Sunday - Imps Rehearsal 
### Occasional events 
- General Meetings (Wednesday Afternoons)
- Candlewasters, and other Supplementary shows. (Usually Friday-Saturday)
- Lock-in (Saturday Nights)
# 3. Practical Advice
## 3.1 BEING IN THE BUILDING
###### This section was reviewed by the Theatre Manager, who can be contacted at theatre@bedlamtheatre.co.uk 
- **At least three members of your production team must get Duty Manager (DM) training as soon as is practical. When rehearsing in Bedlam, you must have a DM trained individual present,** primarily so there is someone present who knows how to lock up.
- *Access* 
  - The DM keys do not give access to the building **and must not leave leave the building at any time.**
  - If you are the first in the building, you should arrange for a Committee member to let you in with at least 24 hours notice. If you have a problem getting in, contact a Committee member. 
  - **Don’t leave the building until you’ve handed over the DM keys to someone else who is Duty Manager trained. If you are the last person out, make sure the fire exits are locked and the door is double locked.**
- Your stage manager is entitled to a set of access keys in the run up to production week and the show. To procure a set, speak to the Theatre Manager. **If you want other members of the production team to have these keys, this must be approved by the Theatre Manager.**
- *Lights* 
  - The switches are in the box to your right as you enter from the side door. The switch labelled ‘Bertha’ will turn on the auditorium flood lights. 
  - Rigged lights are to be used only for dress/tech runs, and shows themselves because they use monumental amounts of electricity. 
- *Smoking* 
  - **Smoking is not permitted anywhere in the building, by law.** Talk to the Theatre Manager about using stage cigarettes. 
- *Tidiness*
  - Put your rubbish in the bin, and empty them if they’re full. We share this space as a Company so love it, and look after it. If you leave the place in a mess, the FOH Manager can get a cleaner in and charge it to your show team. 
## 3.2 SHOW FINANCES
###### This section was reviewed by the Business Manager, who can be contacted at business@bedlamtheatre.co.uk
- **You must stick to your budget. Any overspend that has not been approved will not be reimbursed.** Remind all crew that they are not to spend ANY MONEY without the producer’s say-so and that they MUST give you a receipt if they want to be reimbursed. 
- **Any budget increases or changes must be proposed at a Committee Meeting, consulting with the Business Manager.**
- **Each production will be required to submit a deposits.** 
  - **Deposits are 10% of EUTC grant for shows, £65 for Lunchtime and specified by the Business Manager for other classifications.**
  - Deposits can be in the form of a cheque, or an envelope containing the correct cash. 
  - The deposit will only be cashed if, through negligence, you break or damage Bedlam itself, or some other item held or hired by the EUTC. This is the only way that members are in any way financially liable for breaking things. 
  - Use of the deposit will be discussed by the Committee beforehand and addressed on a case-by-case basis. 
- Invoices for any expenses should be placed in Business Manager’s pigeonhole in the Bedlam Office, or emailed to the Business Manager at *business@bedlamtheatre.co.uk.* This is the same for any receipts for reimbursements. Remember to include name and bank details for each receipt. Make sure the Business Manager knows what needs to be paid urgently (such as rights), as well as keeping them up to date on your expenditure. 
- **Anything you purchase with your show budget (like furniture, paint etc) will be added to the EUTC’s general stock after your run.**
- **Any tech hires must be approved by the Technical Manager.** 
- If you have any problems or questions there is a Business resources section on the Bedlam website. Failing that, please talk to the Business Manager. 
## 3.3 FUNDRAISING
**Fundraisers must be proposed at a Committee meeting.** You should give Committee as much notice as possible. Committee can reject a fundraiser if it clashes with another EUTC event, or if there is insufficient evidence to vote on it. To propose a fundraiser you should explain the following:
- What you are intending to do.
- How and where you are intending to do it.
- A time and a date.
- How much you are intending to fundraise.
- You cannot spend any fundraised money without it first being given to and checked and deposited by the Business Manager
. 
Examples of fundraisers include bake sales, dances, raffles and music nights, but can take almost any form. If you’re stuck for ideas, talk to the Social Events Manager. 
## 3.4 HEALTH AND SAFETY (INCLUDING FIRE AND WEAPONS) 
###### This section was reviewed by the Theatre Manager, who can be contacted at theatre@bedlamtheatre.co.uk
There is an EUTC health and safety folder, maintained by the Theatre Manager. This can be found in the Office. Some key points are: 
- **If your show involves any stunts, stage combat or other things likely to result in injuries, you must notify the Theatre Manager during your first week of rehearsals.**
- Record any accidents in the accident book, and report them to the Theatre Manager. The accident report/near miss book can be found in the Office, or can be found online.
- There is a First Aid kit behind the box office.
- Lifting, building, and carrying: 
  - Only people who have been shown how to do tasks should attempt them. This is especially true of anything potentially dangerous, e.g., use of power tools, rigging, building flats, etc.. If you are unsure of anything, speak to the Theatre, Set, or Technical Managers. 
  
If you intend to have any of these in the performance you MUST discuss it with the Theatre Manager, and follow these regulations: 
- **Naked flames/candles/pyrotechnics cannot be used under any circumstances** without 
extensive consultation with the Theatre Manager.
- **Lasers need permission from the council,** which can take up to two months to come 
through.
- **Smoking is NOT permitted anywhere in the building, by law.** If a show requires smoking, there are prop cigarettes in the prop store. Remember to put it in your Questionnaires if a smoke effect is being used at any point, as the fire alarm has to be isolated. 
- **Firearms need permission from the police.** This can take some time so ask early. Speak to the Set Manager and the Theatre Manager well in advance.
- Theatrical weapons. Bedlam has a black Olympic 6 starting revolver, a black generic handgun, and a deactivated Lee–Enfield rifle. Only the first one can fire blank rounds. Due to the realistic style of these firearms, use of these weapons require extensive consultation well in advance with the Set Manager and Theatre Manager. They are kept in a gun safe, and must not be transported between backstage and there while the building is open. Bedlam also has a wide variety of fake firearms that can be used after a much more brief discussion with the Set Manager and Theatre Manager due to the less realistic nature of these firearms. 
- **Weapons, real or theatrical, must only be used on the stage,** never backstage or on the balconies, nor pointed at the audience. This applies to performances as well. 
## 3.5 WELFARE 
Remain vigilant in regard to the welfare of your cast and crew. 
- **You are required to have two welfare contacts agreed upon by the cast and crew.** Traditionally, the Stage Manager is one. Each welfare contact should have enough distance from the other, personally, that any cast and crew members should feel comfortable speaking to one of them about any matter arising with them. 
- The Productions Manager will make a note of the welfare officers’ names. The Productions Manager and/or the EUTC’s three core welfare contacts (President, Committee-elected and Company-elected) will liaise with them and advise them of their roles.
- Members of cast and crew can go straight to the three EUTC welfare contacts to raise concerns, and do not need a specific reason to do so. - Refer to Articles 3A and 3B of the Constitution and to the Welfare Agreement on the website for further details. 
## 3.6 TECH
###### This section was reviewed by the Technical Manager, who can be contacted at tech@bedlamtheatre.co.uk. 
- **Your show’s technical manager must complete the tech manager’s questionnaire (TMQ) at the latest by the Monday of the week before your performance.** This questionnaire should include documentation of rig plans, a get in plan, DMX runs and planned changes to set up of the tech in the theatre. 
  - **Any planned hires should be run through the EUTC Technical Manager a few weeks in advance of the questionnaire deadline.** 
  - You should seek the advice of the Technical or Theatre Managers regarding health and safety and building regulations. 
  - It might be useful for your show’s technical team to meet with the EUTC Technical Manager, to go through anything they are unsure about in the runup to show week. 
- To ensure your get in is run efficiently, talk not only with your set-building colleagues, but also the tech teams before and after you. Your rig plans might have a lot in common. 
  - **It is imperative that everyone that might be going up a ladder be ladder trained by the EUTC Technical Manager.** A list will be kept by Committee to ensure that safe working practises are maintained. 
  - If you wish to get some more people along to your get in then think about making a Facebook event for the get in on Bedlam techies facebook group to get some extra hands. 
- The technical rehearsal (or tech run) usually falls on the Monday evening of show week, this is a very important time to ensure that the tech for the show is all set up and programmed to a sufficient standard before the dress rehearsal. 
  - It is important that the whole show team and cast understand that *this is the tech team’s time and they are in charge.*
  - The EUTC Technical Manager will be on call for the tech run, dress run and first night for any issues the tech team may have. Their contact details are displayed in the tech box. 
- **Any gels cut for the show must be labelled correctly** (as shown in a poster above the gel cutting station by hard patch) **and returned to the correct file at the end of the show run.** If you cut gel from the rolled gel storage make sure to roll it back up tightly and place it back in the correct slot for the next person to use. 
- **Get out must be completed on the last night of the show.** There is a checklist to ensure nothing is forgotten. A copy should be in the tech box, but there is also a copy here. 
- The tech team should give a list of any equipment that was faulty at the time of get in or during 
the run of the show, follow this link to report faults (*https://www.bedlamtheatre.co.uk/admin/resources/tech*). If something breaks during your run, inform the Technical Manager ASAP so they can do their best to fix it before the next performance or provide some advice. 
## 3.7 SET 
###### This section was reviewed by the Set Manager, who can be contacted at set@bedlamtheatre.co.uk
### Construction 
This generally boils down to:
- If you are not sure, ask the Set Manager.
- Clean up after yourself
- Building things needs to be safe. 
  - **Do not use tools that you have not been tool trained on. Tool training can be arranged easily with the Set Manager with enough notice.** 
  - **Do not use power tools in the building past midnight without permission from the Set Manager**
- Built things need to be safe and legal. 
  - **If cardboard, paper, or polystyrene is to be used in set construction it must be passed by the theatre Manager and treated with the necessary Flamebar flame retardant (N5, S3, or SIWA2).** Bedlam may not have stock of these if you do not get in contact with the Theatre Manager in time (≥2 weeks before Get In).
  - All built things may be inspected by the Set Manager or Theatre Manager. If your construction is somehow classified as unsafe, your production may be suspended until it is rectified (see Constitution Article 6D).

Additional permission (from relevant people, at least 2 weeks in advance) must be sought for:
- **Constructing anything that is not a free-standing structure for use on stage (Set Manager).**
- **Drilling or screwing into the stage (Set and Theatre Managers, will always be discourage)**
- **Attaching anything other than fixtures to the rig (Tech Manager)**
- **Building or painting anywhere other than the stage or the workshop, especially the café and other front of house areas (FOH and Theatre Managers)**
- **Modifying or decorating anywhere not on the stage, like the front of house areas or auditorium walls (FOH and Theatre Managers)**
- **Any construction designed to be walked on that is higher than 600mm (requires Raised Structure licence from the Council, coordinate with Committee).**
- **Any change to the layout of the Bedlam stage and seating plan (generally requires Conversion licence from the Council, coordinate with Committee).**
### Consumables (including paint and wood)
- **No production is entitled to Bedlam’s stock of materials, at any time.** While *Lunchtimes* and *Fresher’s Slots* productions may work with the Set Manager on justifiable use, all other productions must purchase all materials and consumables for their productions. This includes all wood, screws, paint, and tape for their production. These productions can only use Bedlam’s stock of materials in extraordinary cases with permission from the Set Manager.
- Paint
  - It is encouraged to paint the stage and back wall, **but they must be painted back to Flints Black afterwards. Please talk to the Theatre Manager before painting other areas,** including other surfaces of the auditorium.
  - **Please talk to the Set Manager before painting anything from the set or props store.**
  - Paint is found in the paint cupboard. Please ask before using any paint as it may be reserved for a future production. **Please seek permission before using unusual types of paints such as gloss paint, UV, glow in the dark, thermochromic etc.**
  - **Clean up after you have finished!** This includes returning and cleaning all the paint brushes and trays that you have used.
- Wood
  - Wood found in the wood scraps box in the workshop is free to use for any production.
  - Wood found in the timber store on the stage right balcony **cannot be used without permission from the Set Manager.**
## 3.8 PROPS AND SET PIECES 
The Props Store is the Crypt. Some important rules:
- **No glass or ceramics are allowed on stage, unless with explicit verifiable written permission from the Theatre Manager.** 
- **Please don’t modify or paint any props without permission.** If something breaks, please tell the Set Manager. 
- Please return props to the Props Return box just outside the crypt. Please return set where you found it (neatly).
- **You cannot (without permission from the Set Manager) remove any items physically from Bedlam.** This includes EUTC shows that may have photoshoots or be held entirely outside Bedlam. 

Almost anything you can see in Bedlam can be used in your play. **However, if it is not part of the props or set store, you must ask permission from the relevant Committee member:** 
- Cafe and Box Office, ask the Front of House Manager 
- Library, ask the Librarian 
- Tech box and tech store, ask the Tech Manager 
- Workshop, ask the Set Manager 
- Anywhere else, ask the Theatre Manager. 
## 3.9 COSTUMES 
###### This section was reviewed by the Wardrobe Manager, who can be contacted at wardrobe@bedlamtheatre.co.uk
- If you are an EUTC show and want to borrow any costumes contact the Wardrobe Managers. Shows from other societies or projects can borrow from the Bedlam wardrobe but a deposit is required.
- The Wardrobe Managers can give advice on what we have and organise when you can be let into the building.
- When looking through Wardrobe please be mindful as to the state you leave it in; the Wardrobe Managers are not there to clean up after other people.
- There is a Returns box, please put all items you’re returning there. 
- **The walkway in the Wardrobe area is a fire exit and so must be kept clear.**
- **All costumes must be washed/dry cleaned before returning them.** Garments can be altered depending on the circumstances, please discuss with the Wardrobe Managers first or your show team will be billed for a replacement garment.
- If any costumes get damaged, let the Wardrobe Managers know to discuss replacement or 
repairs. 
- If you need any costumes we don’t have at Bedlam, ask the Wardrobe Managers as they may 
have suggestions. 
## 3.10 ARCHIVES
###### This section was reviewed by the Archivist who can be contacted at archive@bedlamtheatre.co.uk
- The Archivist will want to take some photos, or have photos taken, before your performance. Make sure they have a copy of the programme (if you have one) and any posters or flyers to put in the archives. If you have any pictures or items to be archived feel free to hand them in to the Archivist. 
- If you wish your production or aspects of rehearsal to be filmed or documented, contact the Archivist. 
# 4. Giving Back to Bedlam 
## 4.1 GET OUTS 
###### This section was reviewed by the Set Manager, who can be contacted at set@bedlamtheatre.co.uk
A get out is the time that is allocated for your show to undo all the changes that you have made. 
- **It must be completed by 12:00 the day after your final show, unless you request an extension.** The latest a get out can be extended to is 18:00 Sunday, upon the consent of the next show team. 
- The get out is often the most neglected part of a show’s production. It is highly recommended that you plan ahead of what must be done. Remember that everything that you have used must be reverted to how you found it.
- It is recommended that you start your get out immediately after your final show.
- Space in Bedlam for anything new you may have bought for a production is not guaranteed. This includes anything you bought, so you must plan ahead on how to find new homes for everything. Talk to the Set Manager, as some small props and useful set pieces can be kept. 
- For information on extended get outs and get ins, see Section 2.7 
## 4.2 MAINTENANCE
###### This section was reviewed by the Theatre Manager, who can be contacted at theatre@bedlamtheatre.co.uk
- The Sunday after your get-out all cast and crew must attend maintenance at 12:00. If you cannot attend maintenance, contact the Theatre Manager (the night before at the latest) to make alternate arrangements to make up for this.
- Failure to attend maintenance for your show will place you ‘in debt to the Company’, please see Article 7C of the Constitution. 
## 4.3 DEBRIEFING 
- You must attend the Monday Company Meeting after the last performance of your show to report to the Company. 
- This is your chance to talk about what worked or didn’t and for you and Committee members to raise and discuss any problems. 
## 4.4 STAFFING
###### This section was reviewed by the Front of House Manager, who can be contacted at foh@bedlamtheatre.co.uk
- Assigned staffing weeks for each production will be assigned by the Front of House Manager (FoH).
- **All members of a production must staff.** This includes Director(s), Tech Managers, Stage Managers, Producer(s), tech operators, and the cast. This is not limited to those listed on the proposal form. Those involved in a Lunchtime show must staff one slot each, and those involved in a Mainterm show must staff two slots each.
- There are five staffing slots that need to be filled by each production; Duty Manager, Box Office, Indoor Hall Keeper, Outdoor Hall Keeper and Café. The responsibilities of each position are detailed in the Staffing Guidelines. 
- Signing up to staff can be done online through the Bedlam website: *https://www.bedlamtheatre.co.uk/admin/staffings* 
- Staffers must be in Bedlam an hour and a half before the performance or as specified on the 
staffing sign-up page. 
- **A show team must be signed up for at least one slot each by midday Friday on their assigned week** (usually two weeks before the show). Shows are encouraged to staff this week but they can sign up for any slot, including after their show. Mainterm shows must sign up for their second slot by midday Friday the week before their show.
- If you find yourself unable to staff the slot you signed up for, you can request to swap your slot, provided you give at least 24 hours notice. Otherwise, you’ll need to find someone to replace you.
- People staffing when it is not required of them are able to be removed from staffing slots as long 
as at least 24h notice is given.
- If either a Lunchtime or a Mainterm production chooses to have an additional performance, it is the 
producer’s responsibility to find staffers for that performance.
- It is the producer’s responsibility to find staffers for all supplementary events unless another 
agreement is reached with the Front-of-House manager.
